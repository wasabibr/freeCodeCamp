### Courses and Certifications

1. Responsive Web Design (300 hours)
   - [x] Basic HTML and HTML5
     HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser. HTML elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, different elements can describe text as a heading, paragraph, or list item.
   - [x] Basic CSS
     CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML. With CSS, you can control the color, font, size, spacing, and many other aspects of HTML elements.
   - [x] Applied Visual Design
     Visual design is a combination of typography, color theory, graphics, animation, page layout, and more to help deliver your unique message. In this course, you'll learn how to apply these different elements of visual design to your webpages.
   - [x] Applied Accessibility
     In web development, accessibility refers to web content and a UI (user interface) that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. In this course, you'll learn best practices for building webpages that are accessible to everyone.
   - [x] Responsive Web Design Principles
     There are many devices that can access the web, and they come in all shapes and sizes. Responsive web design is the practice of designing flexible websites that can respond to different screen sizes, orientations, and resolutions. In this course, you'll learn how to use CSS to make your webpages look good, no matter what device they're viewed on.
   - [x] CSS Flexbox
     Flexbox is a powerful, well-supported layout method that was introduced with the latest version of CSS, CSS3. With flexbox, it's easy to center elements on the page and create dynamic user interfaces that shrink and expand automatically. In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of flexbox and dynamic layouts by building a Twitter card.
   - [x] CSS Grid
     The CSS grid is a newer standard that makes it easy to build complex responsive layouts. It works by turning an HTML element into a grid, and lets you place child elements anywhere within. In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of CSS grid by building different complex layouts, including a blog.
   - [x] Responsive Web Design Projects
     Time to put your newly learnt skills to work. By working on these projects, you will get a chance to apply all of the skills, principles, and concepts you have learned so far: HTML, CSS, Visual Design, Accessibility, and more.
2. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (300 hours)
   - [ ] Basic JavaScript
     JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers. In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.
   - [ ] ES6
     ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable. Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5, JavaScript is always evolving, and new features are released every year. ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language. In this course, you'll learn these new features, including let and const, arrow functions, classes, promises, and modules.
